What is wisdom?
Philosophers since at least as far back as Socrates have been arguing about how to properly define it.
The least unsatisfactory account of wisdom of which I'm aware is known as the Deep Rationality Theory (DRT).
Roughly, DRT claims that in order to be considered wise one must:
1. have a wide variety of epistemically justified beliefs on a wide variety of valuable academic subjects
2. have a wide variety of justified beliefs on how to live rationally
3. be committed to living rationally
4. have very few unjustified beliefs and be sensitive to cognitive and physical limitations

Does there exist a set of techniques that reliably help one achieve wisdom in this sense?
The purpose of this blog.
